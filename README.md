HOCON-sublime
=============

A [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) syntax for
[HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/) based on the bundled JSON plist definition.

I will be converting the source to [AAAPackageDev](https://bitbucket.org/guillermooo/aaapackagedev)
YAML source format for easier definition.

Known limitations:
- plus-equals (+=) operator syntax isn't defined
- url(), file(), and classpath() notation isn't defined
- this is just the first iteration, and is somewhat usable
